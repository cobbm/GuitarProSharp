A C# library to read GuitarPro tab files. Developed using documentation provided by [PyGuitarPro](https://pypi.org/project/PyGuitarPro/).


## This project consists of two parts - a library and GUI which shows information about a provided GuitarPro song file

**GuitarProSharp** is a library which can read and parse GuitarPro .GP3/.GP4 files.

**GuitarSongEditor** is a GUI application which can be used to open and view the tracks inside a GuitarPro song file. Future versions will allow editing, playback and the creation of new files.
